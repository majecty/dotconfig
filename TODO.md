- [x] create a auto todo skill
- [x] install tailscale

- [ ] run installed local llm running in macbook-pro by tailscale network
- [ ] create global which-key program (Rust - future)
  - (FLTK, Iced, Slint prototypes in bin/whichkey/)
- [ ] nvim rust analyzer
- [x] nvim config organize

  - [ ] review modular config for further minimalism
  - [ ] autotodo: regular update of TODO.md for config changes
- [ ] use homeserver llm

- [ ] firugre out cmd- s currently in w
- [x] oil.nvim
- [ ] gcp skill to create git commit push skill
- [ ] cmd - c is easy to make mistake. change close command to cmd shift c in hyprland confg
- [x] add sandbox config in opencode
  - [ ] Sandbox plugin removed: reliability issues with srt/nosrt sandbox mode.
      - Attempts to auto-retry with nosrt led to inconsistent file permissions and errors (e.g. read-only file system, permission denied).
      - Lessons: Prefer direct command execution unless sandboxing is proven reliable; fallback logic adds complexity and sometimes masks underlying platform or mount issues.
      - Future: If sandbox needed, thoroughly validate cross-platform/FS mechanics and clarify fallback criteria before use.
- [x] ai plugin remove
- [ ] add copilot
- [ ] session setting for nvim
