# TODO - Directory Organization

- [x] global which-key using wofi
  - [x] Create wofi-based which-key wrapper script
  - [x] Bind F11 in Hyprland to launch it
  - [x] Create sample config at ~/.config/whichkey.toml
- [x] create a auto todo skill
- [x] install tailscale

- [ ] run installed local llm running in macbook-pro by tailscale network
- [ ] create global which-key program (Rust - future)
  - (FLTK, Iced, Slint prototypes in bin/whichkey/)
- [ ] nvim rust analyzer
- [x] nvim config organize
  - [x] migrate to feature-based modular structure (files per feature in lua/plugins, minimal init.lua, lazy loaded)
  - [ ] review modular config for further minimalism
    - [x] Centralized all <leader> keymaps with which-key
  - [ ] autotodo: regular update of TODO.md for config changes
- [ ] use homeserver llm
- [x] ctrl-s to save
- [x] figured out cmd-s in Hyprland: SUPER+S toggles special workspace 'magic', no remap needed
- [x] oil.nvim
    - [x] Removed netrw settings to prevent conflict; oil.nvim is now exclusive directory handler.
- [ ] gcp skill to create git commit push skill
- [ ] cmd - c is easy to make mistake. change close command to cmd shift c in hyprland confg
- [x] add sandbox config in opencode
  - [ ] Sandbox plugin removed: reliability issues with srt/nosrt sandbox mode.
      - Attempts to auto-retry with nosrt led to inconsistent file permissions and errors (e.g. read-only file system, permission denied).
      - Lessons: Prefer direct command execution unless sandboxing is proven reliable; fallback logic adds complexity and sometimes masks underlying platform or mount issues.
      - Future: If sandbox needed, thoroughly validate cross-platform/FS mechanics and clarify fallback criteria before use.
- [x] ai plugin remove
- [ ] add copilot
- [ ] session setting for nvim
  - [ ] add shortcut in whichkey that reload session
- [ ] whichkey based keymap
- [ ] save outfocus
- [ ] hyprland config make a window bigger twice
- [x] file tree in nvim for directory tour
  - [x] Added nvim-tree as secondary file explorer (oil is primary)
